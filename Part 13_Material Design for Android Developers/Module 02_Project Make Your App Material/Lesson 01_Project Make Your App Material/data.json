Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must \"meet specifications\" in order to pass.\n\n**Note**:  Please make sure you **clean** your project before creating a zip file or pushing code to a GitHub repository. You can clean your project by following the instructions given in **[this](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/June/5769c116_1000-files-tutorial/1000-files-tutorial.pdf)** link.\n\nIf you are using GitHub to host your projects, please make sure the code you want to submit for review is in the **master** branch of your repository.\n\n**IMPORTANT: If you're submitting via a public Github repository, please make sure any external API key that you utilize, has been removed from your code.**  It's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos, so you need to remove yours. You can add a note in a README file where a reviewer should go to insert their API key. Reviewers have been trained to expect this situation.\n\nDue to the high volume of submissions, the turnaround for your project can take up to a week.\n\nEach Android ND project will be reviewed against the<a href=\"http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Common Project Requirements</a>, in addition to its project-specific rubric.",

The app will need multiple improvements. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UI Review. \n* Execute the improvements! \n* Make a single GitHub repo with your code for the app and submit it through the Nanodegree portal. See the Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions. \n\nFor detailed information on how your project will be assessed, see the Rubric node.",
