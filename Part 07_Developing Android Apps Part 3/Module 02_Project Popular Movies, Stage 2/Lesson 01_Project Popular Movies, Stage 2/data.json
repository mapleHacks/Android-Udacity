In this second and final stage, you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.\n\nYou’ll add more information to your movie details view:\n\n* You’ll allow users to view and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser).\n* You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.\n* You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button (star).\n* You'll make use of Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle) to create a robust an efficient application.\n* You'll create a database using Room to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while offline).\n* You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.\n\nRecall from Stage 1, you built a UI that presented the user with a grid of movie posters, allowed users to change sort order, and presented a screen with additional information on the movie selected by the user:",

Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must \"meet specifications\" in order to pass.\n\n**Note**:  Please make sure you **clean** your project before creating a zip file or pushing code to a GitHub repository. You can clean your project by following the instructions given in **[this](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/June/5769c116_1000-files-tutorial/1000-files-tutorial.pdf)** link.\n\nIf you are using GitHub to host your projects, please make sure the code you want to submit for review is in the **master** branch of your repository.\n\n**IMPORTANT: If you're submitting via a public Github repository, please make sure any external API key that you utilize, has been removed from your code.**  It's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos, so you need to remove yours. You can add a note in a README file where a reviewer should go to insert their API key. Reviewers have been trained to expect this situation.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Make sure not to forget to move all the hardcoded Strings in your project to the strings.xml file. If you are unsure how to do this, revisit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=PRVXiM7v3Ds\">this video</a> from Advanced Android Apps.**\n\nEach Android ND project will be reviewed against the<a href=\"http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Common Project Requirements</a>, in addition to its project-specific rubric.",
