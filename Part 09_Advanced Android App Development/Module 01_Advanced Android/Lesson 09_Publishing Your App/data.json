              "text": "# Determining App Setup\n\nNow’s the time to determine much of your app’s setup. When publishing to Google Play, you’ll need to decide on a certain number of details:\n\n### Content Rating Level\nYour app's content rating level inform users of it's maturity level. The possible rating levels are:\n- Everyone\n- Low maturity\n- Medium maturity\n- High maturity \n\n\n### Country Distribution\nDetermine what countries and territories you'd like to distribute your app in. Usually, developers want to distribute as widely as possible to grow their customer base, but you may decide there are certain app requirements, launch dependencies or business needs which may cause you to exclude certain countries.\n\nThe countries you decide to launch in will affect:\n- The need for localized app resources\n- The need for localized app descriptions in the Developer Console\n- Country specific requirements\n- Time zone support\n- Local pricing\n\n### App's Overall Size\nAs of the time of this publishing, the max size for an APK published on Google Play is 100MB. If your app is larger than this, Google Play allows you to attach two large expansion files that supplement your APK. To set this up, use [APK Expansion Files](https://developer.android.com/google/play/expansion-files.html). \n\nAlso, before you build your release-ready APK, run [Proguard](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html) to remove unused code and resources to shrink the size of your app binary.\n\n### Confirm Target Platform Versions & Device Screens\nEnsure your app runs on the Android platform versions and device screen sizes you plan on.\n\nDouble-check the *minSdkVersion* which is the minimum version your app will be compatible with. Android platform versions are defined by the [API level](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels). \n\nFor device screen sizes, run the app on a range of screen sizes and pixel densities. Checkout the [Support Multiple Screens](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html) guide to understand how to prepare your app. Additionally, see the current breakdown of Android platform versions and screen sizes available in the world in the [Device Dashboard](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) to help you decide which versions and screen sizes to you'd like to target.  \n\nAdditionally, there are a number of 3rd party testing platforms that allow you to test your app on many real devices all in the cloud. For example, [Xamarin Test Cloud](https://www.xamarin.com/test-cloud). \n\n### Free or Priced App?\nYou can publish your app as free to download or priced.\n\nFree apps can be downloaded by any Android user in Google Play. Free apps must remain free; however, you can still sell [In-app Products](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_overview.html#products) and [Subscriptions](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_subscriptions.html) via Google Play's In-app [Billing Service](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/index.html). \n\nPriced apps can be downloaded only by users who are in a country that supports paid downloads and have registered a form of payment in Google Play, such as a credit card or Direct Carrier Billing. Priced apps can be changed to free at any time.\n\nIf you do decide on a priced app or are selling in-app products, you'll need to setup a [Google payments merchant account](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/index.html) before you can publish.\n\n### In-app Billing or Android Pay\n\nIf your are looking for more ways to monetize your app and build engagement, you should consider [In-app Billing](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/index.html) \n which allows you to you sell either downloadable digital content in your app such media files or photos or Android Pay which simplifies selling physical goods and services such as food or clothing to your users.\n\n### Set Product Prices\nIf your app is priced or you’re selling in-app or physical products, determine the currency or types of currencies you’d like to accept. You have the flexibility in the Developer Console to price products individually in different currencies so you can adjust according to exchange rates and market conditions.\n\n- [Offer apps in multiple currencies](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/1169947)\n- [Setup prices & app distribution for your app's country](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6334373?visit_id=1-636275525080183095-4138352002&rd=1#paid_free)\n- [Transaction fees](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/112622)\n- [Tax rates & value-added tax](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/138000)\n\n### Start Localization\nLastly, make sure your app meets localization needs. This includes app resources (e.g. strings, images, etc), your app's Google Play store listing details, and graphic assets screenshots, and videos.\n\nReview the  [Localization Checklist](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/localization-checklist.html) for key steps. \n\nFor Resource localization, checkout the [Localizing with Resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization.html) guide.

Applications installed on an Android device must be digitally signed with a certificate that is owned by the app’s developer. In other words, the developer holds a private key to the app’s certificate.

Navigate to the License file for any project, to see which license they use. \n- The <a href=\"https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apache License</a> is an open source software license popularly used for products users can freely use, modify, and distribute. \n- Another popular open source license is the <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\" target=\"_blank\">MIT license</a>. The MIT license is shorter, simpler, and allows users more freedom in using your product than the Apache License does.  \n- If you need help choosing between types of open source licenses, check out <a href=\"http://www.choosealicense.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.choosealicense.com</a> to help you decide which open source license best fits your situation.\n\nYou can also check out the EULA for apps you commonly use already. \n\nIf you have downloaded the Udacity app on your device, you can see the license wording we use directly in the app in the Settings menu, under License.\n\nGoogle also has specific EULAs for their apps - for example, check out the one in Maps under the Settings menu.\n",

              "text": "# Configuring Your App for Release\n\nWith all the necessary materials gathered, let’s start configuring your app for release. This step involves making some configuration changes to the source code, resource files, and app manifest. Some of these steps are optional, but highly encouraged as good coding practices.\n\nFollow these steps (All steps listed below have been taken from the [Configuring Your Application for Release](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/preparing.html#publishing-configure) section of the [Prepare for Release](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/preparing.html) guide):\n\n### Choose a good package name\nMake sure you choose a package name that is suitable over the life of your application. You cannot change the package name after you distribute your application to users. You can set the package name in application's manifest file. For more information, see the [package](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html#package) attribute documentation.\n\n### Turn off logging and debugging\nMake sure you deactivate logging and disable the debugging option before you build your application for release. You can deactivate logging by removing calls to [Log](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html)methods in your source files. You can disable debugging by removing the *android:debuggable* attribute from the *<application>* tag in your manifest file, or by setting the *android:debuggable* attribute to *false* in your manifest file. \nAlso, remove any log files or static test files that were created in your project.\n\nAlso, you should remove all [Debug](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug.html) tracing calls that you added to your code, such as [startMethodTracing()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug.html#startMethodTracing()) and [stopMethodTracing()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Debug.html#stopMethodTracing()) method calls.\n\n### Clean up your project directories\nClean up your project and make sure it conforms to the directory structure described in [Android Projects](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/index.html#ApplicationProjects). Leaving stray or orphaned files in your project can prevent your application from compiling and cause your application to behave unpredictably. At a minimum you should do the following cleanup tasks:\n\n- Review the contents of your *jni/, lib/, and src/* directories. The *jni/* directory should contain only source files associated with the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html), such as *.c, .cpp, .h, and .mk* files. The *lib/* directory should contain only third-party library files or private library files, including prebuilt shared and static libraries (for example, *.so* files). The *src/* directory should contain only the source files for your application (*.java* and *.aidl* files). The *src/* directory should not contain any *.jar* files.\n\n- Check your project for private or proprietary data files that your application does not use and remove them. For example, look in your project's *res/* directory for old drawable files, layout files, and values files that you are no longer using and delete them.\n\n- Check your *lib/* directory for test libraries and remove them if they are no longer being used by your application.\n\n- Review the contents of your *assets/* directory and your *res/raw/* directory for raw asset files and static files that you need to update or remove prior to release.\n\n\n### Review and update your manifest and Gradle build settings\nVerify that the following manifest and build files items are set correctly:\n\n- [<uses-permission>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-permission-element.html) element. You should specify only those permissions that are relevant and required for your application.\n\n- *android:icon* and *android:label* attributes. You must specify values for these attributes, which are located in the [<application>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html) element. \n\n- *android:versionCode* and *android:versionName* attributes. We recommend that you specify values for these attributes, which are located in the [<manifest>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element.html) element. For more information see [Versioning your Application](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning.html)\n\nThere are several additional manifest or build file elements that you can set if you are releasing your application on Google Play. For example, the *android:minSdkVersion* and *android:targetSdkVersion* attributes, which are located in the [<uses-sdk>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html) element. For more information about these and other Google Play settings, see [Filters on Google Play](https://developer.android.com/google/play/filters.html)\n\n\n### Address compatibility issues\nAndroid provides several tools and techniques to make your application compatible with a wide range of devices. To make your application available to the largest number of users, consider doing the following:\n\n- **Add support for multiple screen configurations**: Make sure you meet the [best practices for supporting multiple screens](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#screen-independence). By supporting multiple screen configurations you can create an application that functions properly and looks good on any of the screen sizes supported by Android.\n\n- **Optimize your application for Android tablet devices.**: If your application is designed for devices older than Android 3.0, make it compatible with Android 3.0 devices by following the guidelines and best practices described in [Optimizing Apps for Android 3.0](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/optimizing-for-3.0.html).\n\n- **Consider using the Support Library**: If your application is designed for devices running Android 3.x, make your application compatible with older versions of Android by adding the [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index.html) to your application project. The Support Library provides static support libraries that you can add to your Android application, which enables you to use APIs that are either not available on older platform versions or use utility APIs that are not part of the framework APIs.\n\n### Update URLs for servers and services\nIf your application accesses remote servers or services, make sure you are using the production URL or path for the server or service and not a test URL or path.\n\n### Implement Licensing (if you are releasing on Google Play)\nIf you are releasing a paid application through Google Play, consider adding support for Google Play Licensing. Licensing lets you control access to your application based on whether the current user has purchased it. Using Google Play Licensing is optional even if you are releasing your app through Google Play.\n\nFor more information about Google Play Licensing Service and how to use it in your application, see [Application Licensing](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/index.html).\n\n",

All the work you put into preparing your app will be worth it when users get it into their hands.\n\n**Before opening the floodgates and letting anyone access your app, it’s highly, highly recommended that you user test.**\n\nUser testing means finding real, live users to use your application, gathering their feedback on what works well and what doesn't to improve your app's experience.\n\nDuring the development process, you should be testing along the way to catch any bugs and to make sure you’re moving the the right direction. \n\nUser testing, especially pre-launch, can help you optimize for the smoothest user experience. Listening to your users is crucial to building features they actually want so they keep coming back. \n\nThe Google Play Developer Console helps you test with an initial small group, called alpha testers, before moving on to a larger group of beta testers.\n\nThese testers cannot leave reviews or ratings, so there is no risk to your app’s Google Play rating.\n\n## Find Testers\n\nFirst you’ll need to find testers. Consider your personal circles - friends, family, coworkers, classmates, and community members. For example, if you built an app for dog lovers to track their daily walks, you might find dog enthusiasts at Meetup groups who could be your future users.\n\nAnother source is an online site such as Reddit, which has sub-reddits specifically for <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/alphaandbetausers/\" target=\"_blank\">alpha/beta testers</a>, beta testers, and Android apps.",
