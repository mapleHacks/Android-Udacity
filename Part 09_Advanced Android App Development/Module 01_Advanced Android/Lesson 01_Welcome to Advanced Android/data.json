In this course, you'll be creating and coding seven different sample apps to learn about the advanced capabilities of Android. They are:\n\n* [AndroidMe](https://github.com/udacity/Android_Me/) - AndroidMe is an app that lets you style your own Android by customizing it's hair and clothing! It uses [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html), modular sections of an Activity, to create a flexible and responsive UI.\n* [Emojify](https://github.com/udacity/AdvancedAndroid_Emojify) - Emojify is a fun app that turns your face in a selfie into an appropriate Emoji based on your facial expression! This app is your introduction to using libraries.\n* [Squawker](https://github.com/udacity/AdvancedAndroid_Squawker/) - Squawker is a social media app where the course instructors send \"Squawks\" whenever the mood strikes. This app shows new server data in real time, in a battery efficient way.\n* [ShushMe](https://github.com/udacity/AdvancedAndroid_Shushme) - ShushMe is an app that turns your device silent whenever you enter any of a list of places of your choice. This app is your introduction to [Geofences](https://developer.android.com/training/location/geofencing.html).\n* [ClassicalMusicQuiz](https://github.com/udacity/AdvancedAndroid_ClassicalMusicQuiz) - This app is simple audio-based quiz where you try to guess the composer by listening to a musical piece! It's your introduction to using [Android Media Players](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer.html).\n* [MyGarden](https://github.com/udacity/AdvancedAndroid_MyGarden) - MyGarden is a plant growing app, you get to add plants to your garden and keep them alive by regularly watering them. This app is your introduction to widgets\n* [TeaTime](https://github.com/udacity/AdvancedAndroid_TeaTime) - TeaTime is a mock tea ordering app that demonstrates various uses of the [Espresso Testing framework](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html) (i.e. Views, AdapterViews, Intents, IdlingResources).\n\n\n## Github\nTo navigate the code, some familiarity with the version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and the associated website [GitHub](https://github.com/) is required. In general, knowledge of how version control systems (also called a VCS) work is a common prerequisite for developer jobs. Git is also a hugely popular VCS and is used by both Google and Udacity.\n\nIf you're not sure what Git or Github are and how to use them, we suggest taking the [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) about it. There's also plenty of other resources to get you started, such as GitHub's own [interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). To use our repositories, you'll need to be comfortable with the following skills:\n\n* How to clone a GitHub repo\n* How to read a diff on GitHub\n* What a branch in git is\n* How to switch between branches using the checkout command\n* How to stage and commit code\n\n## Structure of the Course Code\n\nEach code repository in this class has a chain of commits that looks like this:\n\n\n\n",
