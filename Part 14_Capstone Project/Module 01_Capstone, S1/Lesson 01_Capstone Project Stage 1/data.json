In Stage 1, you will design and plan the app, using a template that we provide in the \"Instructions\" node. \n\nCreating and building your own app idea can be both exciting and daunting; ultimately, we want the experience to be rewarding. You'll apply a wealth of different concepts and components that you've learned across the Nanodegree to bring you own app idea to life.  \n\nTo keep the process from becoming overwhelming (or simply chaotic), you will design and plan your app, and receive feedback, *before* you start building. This will help prevent and mitigate pain points you might run into along the way, and also replicates the process of professional Android Developers.\n\n## Why this Project?\n\nTo become a proficient Android Developer, you need to design apps and make plans for how to implement them. This will involve choices such as how you will store data, how you will display data to the user, and what functionality to include in the app. \n\n## What Will I Learn?\n\nThrough this project, you'll demonstrate the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:  \n\n* An app description\n* UI flow mocks, similar to what you've seen in other Nanodegree projects, like the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true\" target=\"_blank\">Popular Movies overview</a>\n* A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order\n\nThe Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full development of an app. This first stage replicates the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.",
