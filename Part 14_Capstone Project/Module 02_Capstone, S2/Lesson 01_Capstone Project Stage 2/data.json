Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must \"meet specifications\" in order to pass.\n\n**Note**:  Please make sure you **clean** your project before creating a zip file or pushing code to a GitHub repository. You can clean your project by following the instructions given in **[this](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/June/5769c116_1000-files-tutorial/1000-files-tutorial.pdf)** link.\n\nIf you are using GitHub to host your projects, please make sure the code you want to submit for review is in the **master** branch of your repository.\n\n**IMPORTANT: If you're submitting via a public Github repository, please make sure any external API key that you utilize, has been removed from your code.**  It's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos, so you need to remove yours. You can add a note in a README file where a reviewer should go to insert their API key. Reviewers have been trained to expect this situation.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Make sure not to forget to move all the hardcoded Strings in your project to the strings.xml file. If you are unsure how to do this, revisit <a href=\"https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud855/lessons/4299539001/concepts/43103546100923\">this video</a> in Advanced Android Apps.**\n\nDue to the high volume of submissions, the turnaround for your project can take up to a week.\n\nEach Android ND project will be reviewed against the<a href=\"http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Common Project Requirements</a>, in addition to its project-specific rubric.",
